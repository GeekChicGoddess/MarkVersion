                    <p>I just got off my first phone call with “Mark the consultant” and I have three immediate impressions.</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Mark’s smarter than me.&nbsp;</li>
                      <li>I like him.</li>
                      <li>I also hate him a little bit.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Mark strikes me as incredibly organized and intentional. &nbsp;Primarily a corporate background, he also has a successful small business under his belt. &nbsp;He’s one of those people that sounds very sincere when he say’s “start with the end in mind”, because he wants new business owners to start their business with a clear plan for how they’ll exit it. &nbsp;That’s what he did with his small business, and he means it when he says it to others.</p>
                    <p><img src="https://cdn.flutter.co/exitoasis/uploads/GOvmkSJBSyKPSpGS4xXI_1 kneeling.jpg" class="fr-draggable fr-dii fr-fil" style="width: 300px; height: 200.393px;"></p>
                    <p><a href="https://pixabay.com/en/man-work-race-bike-finish-line-sport-fin-2032616/"></a> This puts me in a horrible dilemma.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>I love the advice.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>It’s wise.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>It’s logical.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>And I can’t conceive of following it.</p>
                    <p>I’m really conflicted here. &nbsp;The advice makes perfect sense, but it runs completely counter to my life experience. &nbsp;Mark’s not the only one who gives this advice. &nbsp;There is an entire exit planning industry that would love all new business owners to fall in love with the phrase “start with the end in mind”.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://pixabay.com/en/london-marathon-running-runners-2294025/"></a> But when they say it, I can’t help but feel that they are out of touch with what it means for most of us to start a business. &nbsp;When they say, “start with the end in mind”, it feels like they see the choice of starting a business as a logical, reasonably considered, thoughtfully executed process.</p>
                    <p>When<strong>&nbsp;f</strong><strong>or many of us, starting a business isn’t an act of careful execution - it’s an act of exorcism.</strong></p><img src="https://cdn.flutter.co/exitoasis/uploads/4LNBRv5QdqHuIN2toOxx_3 walk.jpg" class="fr-draggable fr-dii fr-fir" style="width: 236px; height: 355.5px;">

                    <p>Map out the path. &nbsp;Define the end. &nbsp;And start.</p>
                    <p>With that end in mind.</p>

                    <p>Sit calmly and contemplate my anticipated business journey.</p>
                    <p>Flip out when I realize how likely failure is and try to ignore the business idea for as long as I can.</p>

                    <p>Fight the butterflies in my stomach.</p>

                    <p>Makes me sound super cool, right? &nbsp;My start-up truth hasn’t been cool. &nbsp;It’s been an ugly, anxiety fueled wrestling match between my doubt and my drive.</p>
                    <p>I’ve started 4 businesses from scratch and purchased 2 others. &nbsp;I’ve been lucky enough to have several successful exits (with a failure or two thrown in to keep me humble.)&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>My new start-up is in the “exit your business” space, and I’m consuming a lot of content from exit planners right now. &nbsp;Over and over they tell me to “start with the end in mind”, and it just doesn’t make sense.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                      <p>In the last 60 seconds I’ve felt frustrated, excited, discouraged and wildly optimistic. &nbsp;In a word: messy.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>That’s the start of the blog post from five months ago when I started my business.</p><img src="https://cdn.flutter.co/exitoasis/uploads/cQZTlbO4TK2PQOKtjrb8_5 shorts.jpg" class="fr-draggable fr-dii fr-fir" style="width: 363px; height: 244.881px;">
                    <p>Does it trouble you to hear a business owner voice apprehension, doubt and concern? &nbsp; Then you’ve never spent much time around business owners. &nbsp;Doubt is a truth of this life. &nbsp; At least it’s always been for me.</p>
                    <p>My hope at the time, and currently, is that this new thing will be wildly successful and consume me professionally for the next decade or two. &nbsp;I’m optimistic based on how things are going, but I’m also aware that it’s 50/50 that I’ll have to quietly wrap it up 36 months from now. &nbsp;If that happens, I need to come up with an explanation that doesn’t include the words “catastrophic failure”.</p>
                    <p>Now, I can hear the “you’re never going to succeed with that kind of attitude” calls through my computer screen as I write this. &nbsp;But I’ll politely say, save them for someone with less faith.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><img src="https://cdn.flutter.co/exitoasis/uploads/ti7ovgkkROeFp2m1KGaP_6 stretch.jpg" class="fr-draggable fr-fir fr-dii"></p>
                    <p><a href="https://pixabay.com/en/stretching-sports-woman-athlete-498256/"></a> <span style="font-size: 18px;"><span style="color: rgb(41, 105, 176);">Starting is an Act of Faith</span></span>
                    </p>
                    <p>Every business I’ve started from scratch was ultimately an act of faith. &nbsp;Part ritual and part therapeutic extraction. &nbsp;I was driven by a desire to do a thing and was finally able to generate enough belief to try and make it happen. &nbsp;These start-ups were acts of faith, not acts of calculated capitalism.</p>
                    <p>In most cases I put off starting until it became clear that my choice was either to do the thing or whither from the regret of not doing it.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>My wife will tell you I’m one of the most methodical thinkers you’ll meet, but when it comes to my start-ups, it wasn’t about making a planned, “consider the end” decision to go or no. &nbsp; It was about built-up desire momentarily overcoming my fear.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>I’ve always loved Michael Gerber’s description of the “entrepreneurial seizure” that creates the start of most businesses.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p><em>Inside your mind it sounded something like this; “what am I doing this for? &nbsp;Why am I working for this guy? &nbsp;Hell, I know as much about this business as he does. &nbsp;If it weren’t for me, he wouldn’t have a business. &nbsp;Any dummy can run a business. . .Once you were stricken with an Entrepreneurial Seizure,<strong>&nbsp;there was no relief. &nbsp;You couldn’t get rid of it. &nbsp;You had to start your own business.</strong></em></p>
                      <p>The E-Myth Revisited, page 12</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p><a href="https://pixabay.com/en/overcoming-race-yellow-marathon-courage--993579/"></a> Oh, and by the way, while you're having that seizure, keep the end in mind.</p>
                    <p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><span style="color: rgb(41, 105, 176);">I’ve Found it Easier to Buy with the End in Mind.</span></span>

                    <p>I’ve started twice with the end in mind, but both times with businesses I purchased. &nbsp;I was shopping for businesses I thought I could turn-around and sell within 3-5 years. &nbsp;It was primarily a mental exercise, an investment equation, all driven by targeted outcomes – and the end was very much in mind at the start.</p>
                    <p>These were decisions, but my start-ups were about desire.</p>
                    <p>And this is where I think the “start with the end in mind” mind-set can really go off the rails.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://pixabay.com/en/jogging-run-sport-forest-nature-3216189/"></a> <span style="font-size: 18px;"><span style="color: rgb(41, 105, 176);">Why They Say It</span></span>
                    </p>
                    <p>When exit planners beg business owners to “start with the end in mind” they do so with good intentions and for good reasons. &nbsp;They want you to avoid the pain they’ve seen other business owners experience.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://pixabay.com/en/run-colors-fall-colorrun-3302509/"></a></p>
                    <p>Most exit planners have tried to help owners through difficult and discouraging situations. &nbsp;Situations where some simple forethought might have made all the difference.&nbsp;</p><img src="https://cdn.flutter.co/exitoasis/uploads/rQOUrrSTCaPqYY4gWEYo_9 Cover.jpg" class="fr-draggable fr-dii fr-fil">
                    <p>The business owner is burnt-out, discouraged and finally ready to exit their business. &nbsp;But it’s the first time they’ve given an exit more than a passing thought, and now it’s all they think about. &nbsp;Then they quickly discover that their business is unsellable.</p>
                    <p>If only they had thought ahead!</p>
                    <p>It’s a painful place <a href="https://exitoasis.com/the-embarrassing-reason-my-business-was-unsellable-and-the-awkward-way-i-fixed-it" target="_blank">to find yourself as a business owner</a>. &nbsp;And it’s hard to try <a href="https://exitoasis.com/brian-wants-to-sell-his-business-every-56-minutes" target="_blank">to help the owner as a consultant</a>.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>When you see the pain and destruction of poor planning, starting with the end in mind makes real sense. &nbsp;It’s wise and incredibly beneficial.</p>
                    <p>And if the argument was “hey, Bozo, take a minute before you start and consider that you’re not going to want to do this forever” I’d be all for it. &nbsp;Some planners do that, but the problem is that too many don’t stop there. &nbsp;They send out things like this:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p><em>When Should I Develop My Exit Plan?&nbsp;</em></p>
                      <p><em>1. You should begin your exit plan when you start your business.&nbsp;</em></p>
                      <p><em>2. The first part of the exit plan is growing a profitable business that would be attractive to potential buyers or new owners.&nbsp;</em></p>
                      <p><em>3. You must grow a <strong>profitable business from day one</strong> and then you are always able to exit your business.&nbsp;</em></p>
                    </blockquote><img src="https://cdn.flutter.co/exitoasis/uploads/nycFoivPQCOiRWQU4gig_10 sweat.jpg" class="fr-draggable fr-dii fr-fir" style="width: 349px; height: 349px;">
                    <p>“Grow a profitable business from day one”, who is this guy?&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><a href="https://pixabay.com/en/runner-jogger-jogging-young-exercise-fit-952526/"></a> Has he ever started a business? &nbsp;How big is the silver spoon in his mouth? &nbsp;Has he ever had to decide between paying the minimum balance on the credit card or buying more paper for the printer?</p>
                    <p>Has he ever made mistake after mistake as he learns his way through a new thing?</p>
                    <p>Has he ever worked a full-time job and then done another eight hours working on the business he wants to start? &nbsp;Profitable from day one?</p>
                    <p>This sort of message drives me crazy. &nbsp;It’s so robotic, so mechanical, so “corporate clean” and so disconnected from the real choices most aspiring business owners face. &nbsp; It's a very broken "start with the end in mind" adaptation, and so very, very discouraging to someone starting out.</p>
                    <p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><span style="color: rgb(41, 105, 176);">Running with Baby Sharks</span></span>
                    </p>
                    <p>Between business ownership gigs I took the opportunity to work for three years helping aspiring entrepreneurs start new businesses. &nbsp;It was a fabulous adventure. &nbsp;Every day was populated with people who had and overabundance of ideas and energy, and a lack of experience and know-how.</p>
                    <p>With rare exception, each had a mountain of learning to do and overwhelming challenges to face. &nbsp;The primary assets they had were the energy and enthusiasm generated by their blind optimism, their passion for their idea, and their desire for business ownership.</p>
                    <p><img src="https://cdn.flutter.co/exitoasis/uploads/NOeuIseNQOjgVO7tMiuz_11 Kids.jpg" class="fr-draggable fr-dii fr-fil" style="width: 342px; height: 228px;"></p>
                    <p><a href="https://pixabay.com/en/running-race-running-race-sport-competit-942110/"></a> Because of what they lacked most of their decisions were made under the gun, with too little time, too little money, and too many options. &nbsp;They did the best they could each day and started the next day eager to make a little more progress.</p>
                    <p>They knew failure was a likely outcome. &nbsp;They knew the path between their start and financial stability was a rough and unclear one. &nbsp;They moved forward anyways. &nbsp;Pivoting, evolving and exploring.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://pixabay.com/en/marathon-sport-children-run-autumn-park--1797898/"></a> Dealing with them was energizing and exhausting – and unquestionably inspiring.&nbsp;</p><img src="https://cdn.flutter.co/exitoasis/uploads/KggkdJcoSfmxSvrXY8E7_12 skip.jpg" class="fr-draggable fr-fir fr-dii" style="width: 416px; height: 276.374px;">
                    <p>Those starter-uppers inspired me, and I’m back in a start-up. &nbsp;I have a vague idea how this might end, but I also know that odds say failure is likely.</p>
                    <p>So again, it’s messy, but it’s real.</p>
                    <p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><span style="color: rgb(41, 105, 176);">The Exit Planners are Right, But Some Aren’t Good at Capitalization</span></span>
                    </p>
                    <p>An exit plan can be of huge value to a business owner interested in a successful exit. &nbsp;And without question, most business owners wait way, way, WAY too long to start the exit planning process.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Most business owners won’t plan for their exit. &nbsp;Almost all will regret it.</p>
                    <p>I believe in exit planning. &nbsp;If you want to sell your business, <a href="https://exitoasis.com/meet-bill-your-buyer" target="_blank">you need to intentionally build, design and manage that business with your exit in mind</a>. &nbsp;The sale of your business will not happen by accident.</p>
                    <p>And if you’re like Mark, and can do it from the start, more power to you. &nbsp;But here’s where I think some in that crowd get it wrong.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>The message shouldn’t be <strong>START WITH THE END IN MIND</strong></p>
                    <p>It should be <strong>START</strong> <span style="font-size: 8px;">with the end in mind. &nbsp;</span>Oh, and leave out the "grow a profitable business from day one" stuff. &nbsp;It just makes you look pretentious and silly.</p>
                    <p><img src="https://cdn.flutter.co/exitoasis/uploads/AP5BydFnTHKuNpwf6d3P_13 Just start.jpg" class="fr-dib fr-draggable" style="width: 403px; height: 201.5px;"></p>
                    <p><a href="https://pixabay.com/en/runners-running-jogging-start-marathon-y-1517155/"></a> <span style="font-size: 18px;"><span style="color: rgb(41, 105, 176);">Just Start</span></span>
                    </p>
                    <p>If you can’t see the end, you should start anyways. Do it. &nbsp;Get going. &nbsp;Don’t wait.</p>
                    <p>Not sure where it’s going to end? &nbsp;Join the crowd. &nbsp;If you’re like me, thinking about “how it will end” leads to repeatedly Googling “what percent of start-ups end in failure”. &nbsp;If you have an end in mind, fabulous, if you don’t then start anyways. Don’t kill your desire because you don’t know where this is going to go.</p>
                    <p>And then, as soon as you can, start thinking about the end. &nbsp;<a href="https://exitoasis.com/your-bus-isnt-a-boat-just-because-you-drive-it-to-the-ocean" target="_blank">Your desire to exit will almost certainly sneak up on you</a>. &nbsp;The sooner you start thinking about it, the better chance you have at a successful exit.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>By the way, I don’t hate Mark because he wants small business owners to “start with the end in mind”. &nbsp;It's wise advice, especially when the advice is delivered as thoughtfully and reasonably as Mark does it. &nbsp;</p>
                    <p>No, that's not why I hate Mark.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>I hate Mark because he’s smarter than me.</p>
